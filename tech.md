### React Query

A powerful library for managing, caching, and syncing server state in React applications. In my little experience, it is the best library for managing server state in React applications, it handles everything from fetching,mutation, revalidation,caching, pagination, and more. You can read about the motivation behind React Query [here](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview#motivation).

### React query kit

A toolkit for ReactQuery that make ReactQuery hooks reusable and typesafe.

> [!NOTE]
> What could you benefit from it
>
>- Manage `queryKey` in a type-safe way
>- Make `queryClient`'s operations clearly associated with custom ReactQuery hooks
>- You can extract the TypeScript type of any custom ReactQuery hooks
>- Middleware

### zod

A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. I use it to validate forms and API responses to ensure that the data is correct and safe to use. One of the best features of Zod is its ability to infer types from the schema, which makes it easy to use with TypeScript.

### React-native-svg-transformer

Allows importing SVG files in your React Native project the same way that you would in a Web project - using the svg component. I use this package when I want to import SVGs as ReactNative components or have to create a custom icon library for each project Documenation is [here](https://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-transformer)

How I set it up:

1. Follow the initial set up steps in the documentation

> [!TIP]
> For typescript support, create a `declarations.d.ts` file in the root of your project and add the following code:
>
>```ts
>declare module "*.svg" {
>
>    import React from "react";
>    import { SvgProps } from "react-native-svg";
>    const content: React.FC<SvgProps>;
>    export default content;
>}
>```

2. Project file structure:

```text
└───src
    └──assets
       ├───icons
       │   ├───add.svg
       │   ├───chevron-right.svg
       │   ├───chevron-left.svg
       │   ├───...rest.svg
       │   └─-index.ts
       └───other-assets

```

3. Create an `index.ts` file in the `icons` folder and add the following code:

```ts
export { default as AddIcon } from "./add.svg";
export { default as ChevronRightIcon } from "./chevron-right.svg";
export { default as ChevronLeftIcon } from "./chevron-left.svg";
//...rest of the icons
```

4. Import the icons in your components:

```tsx
import * as icons from "@/assets/icons";
import { SvgProps } from "react-native-svg";

export type IconName = keyof typeof icons;

export interface IconProps extends SvgProps {
  name: IconName;
  size?: number;
}

export function Icon({ name, size, width, height, ...rest }: IconProps) {
  const Icon = icons[name];

  return <Icon {...rest} width={width || size} height={height || size} />;
}
```

5. Use the `Icon` component in your app:

```tsx
import { Icon } from "@/components/Icon";

export function MyComponent() {
  return <Icon name="AddIcon" size={24} />;
}
```

6. Best part? You get type safety for free! 🎉
